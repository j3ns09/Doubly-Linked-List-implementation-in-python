A Linked List you thought was a native list.

Every method and operation a list could have is implemented in this Doubly Linked List.

When printing using the method .print(), it will print as if it was a list but marked with a star at the end:
For example,
ll = LinkedList(1,2,3)
ll.print() 
-> returns [1,2,3]*

print(ll) will just print the LinkedList instance and its location in memory.
